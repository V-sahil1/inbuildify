/**
 * Send an email RIGHT NOW, in the caller's request, instead of queuing it to
 * Bull/Redis. The shared Redis Cloud queue is consumed by whichever worker
 * (across any machine) grabs the job first, so a queued engineer email could be
 * silently picked up and dropped by a competing/stale worker — the API would
 * still report success because queuing succeeded. Sending directly guarantees
 * the caller only sees success when Gmail actually accepts the message, and any
 * real SMTP/attachment failure propagates back instead of vanishing.
 *
 * Resolves S3 attachmentKeys (the same shape the worker accepts) into real
 * attachment buffers before sending.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<{success: boolean, messageId?: string, accepted?: string[], message?: string}>}
